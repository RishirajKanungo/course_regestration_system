What queries need to be done
What UI needs to be implemented
Have all of the code in one folder (one folder for each component: APPS, REGS, ADS)
First start off with the database and make sure that it all makes sense
    Ensure that all of the parts are functioning together and the tables are working with one and another
    See what all needs to be preserved and everything that needs to be added

Wahtever user you are:
    you get specific homepage based on the type of user
        dashboard page

Roadmap TLDR:
    change .sql file
        merge sql file to make sure it all works
    make sure the new sql file works for all of our pages
    create a dashboard page for each user
